Wrapping up
You will often create intermediate files when analyzing data. Rather than storing them in your home directory, you can put them in /tmp, which is where people and programs often keep files they only need briefly. (Note that /tmp is immediately below the root directory /, not below your home directory.) This wrap-up exercise will show you how to do that.

Instructions 1/4

1
Use cd to go into /tmp.
2
List the contents of /tmp without typing a directory name.
3
Make a new directory inside /tmp called scratch.
4
Move /home/repl/people/agarwal.txt into /tmp/scratch. We suggest you use the ~ shortcut for your home directory and a relative path for the second rather than the absolute path.
